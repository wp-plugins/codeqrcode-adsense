CodeQRCode plugin enables you to automatically generate QR codes on each post and page on your wordpress site.

== Description ==

It also enables you to place dynamic QR codes using widget. Dynamic QR codes are easier to scan and enable you to track number of scans, device type, and change URL destination.

**How to auto generate QR codes for each post/page**

Open plugin settings and choose static QR code (for simple QR codes without analytics). Each page/post will have unique QR code redirecting user which scans it to that page.
If you create free CodeQRCode account and paste ApplicationID, dropdown list will show your dynamic QR codes also.

**How to place AdSense ad code ?**

**Advantages of Dynamic QR codes:**

1. Easier to scan (because codeqrcode uses short URL)
2. Ability to change URL later (after placing it on your web site or printing it) - by using codeqrcode dashboard you can change destination URL whenever you want.
3. Scan analytics - using codeqrcode dashboard you can have insight in number of scans, device types used to scan, whether the scan is new or returning, date, time and much more...
